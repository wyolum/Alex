<h2>What We Accomplished in 40 Minutes</h2>

<h3>Phase 1: Security Fixes (11 minutes)</h3>

<strong>Critical Vulnerability Patched</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>CVE-2025-66418 Fixed</strong>: Updated urllib3 from 1.26.6 → 2.6.0</li>
<li>Addressed unbounded decompression chain vulnerability</li>
<li>Updated requests library for compatibility (2.26.0 → 2.32.3)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Dependency Modernization</strong>
Updated 24 packages from 2021 versions to modern 2024-2025 releases:
<ul>
<li>matplotlib: 3.4.2 → 3.9.4</li>
<li>numpy: 1.20.1 → 1.26.4</li>
<li>scipy: 1.7.1 → 1.13.1</li>
<li>Pillow: 8.1.0 → 11.3.0</li>
</ul>

<h3>Phase 2: Dual Monitor Fix (10 minutes)</h3>

Fixed a frustrating issue where Alex's window would span across both monitors on dual-monitor setups.

<h3>Phase 3: Dynamic Panel Resizing (9 minutes)</h3>

This was the game-changer! We completely reimagined the view layout:

<strong>What Changed</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>Before</strong>: Fixed grid layout with unchangeable panel sizes</li>
<li><strong>After</strong>: Fully resizable panels with draggable dividers</li>
</ul>

<strong>Technical Implementation</strong>
<ul>
<li>Replaced Tkinter grid layout with nested PanedWindow widgets</li>
<li>Created 2x2 grid of resizable view panels (Top, Side, Front, Iso)</li>
<li>Added resize event handlers to IsoView class</li>
<li>Views automatically recenter when panels resize</li>
<li>Zoom levels preserved during resize operations</li>
</ul>

<h3>Phase 4: Code Quality Refactoring (10 minutes)</h3>

We performed a comprehensive refactoring to improve long-term maintainability:

<strong>New Modules Created:</strong>
<ul>
<li><strong>ViewConfig</strong> - Centralized configuration constants</li>
<li><strong>ViewPanel</strong> - Reusable panel component (eliminated ~40 lines of duplication)</li>
<li><strong>view_layout</strong> - Separated layout logic (reduced AlexCAD.py by ~90 lines)</li>
</ul>

<strong>Improvements:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Improved resize handler with robust debouncing</li>
<li>Added type hints throughout for better IDE support</li>
</ul>

<h2>Impact Metrics</h2>

<strong>Code Quality</strong>
<ul>
<li>Reduced duplication: ~40 lines eliminated</li>
<li>Improved organization: 3 new focused modules</li>
<li>Net reduction: ~90 lines in main file</li>
<li>Type safety: Type hints throughout</li>
</ul>

<strong>Files Changed</strong>
<ul>
<li>+370 insertions, -101 deletions</li>
<li>3 new modules created</li>
<li>5 files modified</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Takeaways</h2>

<ol>
<li><strong>Security First</strong>: Immediately addressed the critical vulnerability</li>
<li><strong>User-Focused</strong>: Implemented the requested dynamic resizing feature</li>
<li><strong>Quality Matters</strong>: Didn't stop at "working" - refactored for maintainability</li>
<li><strong>Clean Process</strong>: Proper git workflow with feature branches</li>
<li><strong>Zero Downtime</strong>: Alex remained functional throughout all changes</li>
</ol>

<h2>Try It Yourself</h2>
